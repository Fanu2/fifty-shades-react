## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
* npm or Yarn (or pnpm)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Fanu2/fifty-shades-react.git
cd fifty-shades-react

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# 3. Start development server
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

You should now be able to open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or as configured).

---

## 🚀 Usage

Once the dev server is running:

* Navigate the UI to explore pages/components
* Modify components under `src/` as needed
* Use React’s standard workflow (state, props, hooks, etc.)
* Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready output will be in the `build/` (or `dist/`) folder.
